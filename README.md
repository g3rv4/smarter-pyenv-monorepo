# Smarter Pyenv Monorepo

This extension was built from [Poetry Monorepo](https://github.com/ihsan-96/vscode-python-poetry-monorepo), so thank you @ihsan-96!

I decided to start a separate one because I have some needs that were not fully addressed by that extension.

## What does it do?

* Automatically select the python interpreter when you open a file
* Adds a command to the palette so that you can set pytest to use the `/tests` folder of the current active project

## When is this useful?

* If you use `pyenv` to manage you virtual environments
* If you use `poetry` to manage your dependencies
* If you use `pytest` to manage your tests

### Can you support my specific use case?

I don't mind reviewing a PR adding more scenarios as long as they don't break mine :)
